## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Document (SRD) is to describe the client and developer view requirements for the  GamerBridge application.  Client-oriented requirements describe the system from the client’s perspective. These requirements include a description of the different types of users served by the system.  
Developer-oriented requirements describe the system from a software developer’s perspective. These requirements include a detailed description of functional, data, performance, and other important requirements. 

### 1.2 Product Scope
“GamerBridge” is a web-based platform designed to help video game developers showcase their games and receive feedback from customers. The system is a web-based application that creates an environment for producers and consumers of video games to connect. Video game developers are able to connect with a larger population of people and receive more immediate feedback of their products. Over anything, we want to create a comfortable user experience as well as providing a healthy environment.  

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 1.5 Document Overview
Section 1 is a general introduction to the document, intended for any readers. Section 2 is focused on the product and its features. This section is for customers and business stakeholders. Section 3 specifies the requirements and constraints for the product and development process. This section is intended for all stakeholders, especially the development team. 
## 2. Product Overview
GamerBridge is a web-based platform designed to help video game developers showcase their games and receive feedback from customers. Customers can browse different profiles of video game developers, view the status of games, subscribe to their favorite developers, and leave reviews on the games based on their personal experience with the game. Video game developers can manage released games that they display, update game information, and track player engagement.  
### 2.1 Product Functions

### 2.2 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer’s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements 
This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 

#### 3.2.1 Performance
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

#### 3.2.2 Security
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery.

#### 3.2.4 Availability
Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.

#### 3.2.5 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations

#### 3.2.6 Cost
Specify monetary cost of the software product.

#### 3.2.7 Deadline
Specify schedule for delivery of the software product.
