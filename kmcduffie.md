# Kyle McDuffie

## About me
My name is Kyle McDuffie and I am a junior at UNCG. I am a computer science major and hope to make a career out of writing and developing code and hopefully making games somewhere in there. Video games have been my passion since i could hold a controller and i have always wanted it to be my job so i hope i will do well enough in my classes and learn enough to make that dream come true. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope that during my time in this class i will broaden my coding abilites and techniques and make me a better coder and planner with the code i want to make.
